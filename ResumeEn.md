* python3 + WSGI
* SwiftAdapter interconnects with multiple high-level services of HUAWEI CLOUD to facilitate service construction. Swift can achieve high-availability and distributed storage on a small number of nodes. SwiftAdapter provides seamless switchover of cloud services from OBS to Swift,
You can switch storage without adapting to Swift.
* Most users of SwiftAdapter are internal developers of HUAWEI CLOUD and can work with developers of various languages to resolve service interconnection issues.

3. AIGO Smart Technology - AIGO Smart Shopping Applet - Independent development and maintenance
* Aigou Smart Shopping Applet is a WeChat and Alipay applet based on unmanned supermarket client scanning in-store, shopping, and after-sales services.
* Django backend + WeChat applet and Alipay applet frontend
* The QR code of the applet connects to the gate of the unmanned supermarket. Through the serial communication protocol, software development at the gate end is implemented, enabling the QR code of the applet to enter the store and connect to microservices such as AI CV, tracking, and gondolar in the store. In addition, the entrusted deduction function is enabled with WeChat and Alipay, and restricted background management functions are provided for customer service personnel.
* Most users of SwiftAdapter are internal developers of HUAWEI CLOUD and can work with developers of various languages to resolve service interconnection issues.

4. Shanghai Yibao Technology - Search website development (search engine) - Responsible for requirement development and issue modification
* The Search website builds knowledge graph based on the search engine of Huawei wireless tools.
* Django+Neo4j+ElasticSearch+MongoDB
